<h4>This conky config is for i3wm on FreeBSD</h4>

<p>Conky is very configurable and it is able to monitor many system variables and resources. Other options exist, but I prefer to use Conky.</p>

<p>Add the file .conkyrc in your home folder.</p>

<p>Place script called conky-i3bar.sh into ~/.config/i3/</p>
